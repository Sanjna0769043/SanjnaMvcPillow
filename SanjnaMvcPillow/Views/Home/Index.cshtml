        <p>The Sanjna's' Pillow Company is a Canadian based Home Decor company originally founded in 1971</p>

            Hello, my name is Sanjna and I am an expert on pillows. While I’m sure that everyone has some expertise
            when it comes to a pillow since we spend a good 7 to 8 hours or more each night with at least one under our heads,
            I have developed a special interest in finding the right types of pillows that actually help you sleep better.

            When I grew up, I really didn’t have an easy time getting a good night’s sleep because I didn’t understand that pillows are more than
            just bags full of stuffing. In fact, there are many different types of pillows and finding the right one can help you sleep better just like it
            does for me. Plus, I learned all about how your sleeping position affect
            the pillow you are using and which type is best for your particular needs
        </p>
        <p>
            We specialize in Handmade Decorative Pillows that are perfect for your living room or bedroom.
            We work with artisans in India to create our vision of handcrafted unique pieces that celebrate brilliant colors,
            a vibrant culture and a history that spans thousands of years. We work diligently to pass this vision on to our customer's home.
            You can choose to order our pillows with or without inserts based on your needs.

                        Pillows traditionally filled with bird feathers or down can offer a soft and fluffy feeling, however compression is an issue as it requires frequent fluffing to restore its loftiness. Over time, oils from the face and hair seep into the pillow and can cause the feathers to clump together, causing lumpiness and reduced loft. Price can widely vary depending on the ratio of down to feather fill.

                        Memory foam pillows are great for individuals seeking thicker and firmer support.
                        Contoured pillows can be beneficial for providing neck support, however be aware of whether the height is right for your
                        body and your sleeping style (more on this later!). Individuals who sleep hot will want to avoid memory foam as it can easily
                        trap heat.
